  <h3>What is Overwatch?</h3>
  <p>Overwatch 2 is a 5v5 team shooter game with multiple different playable heroes to choose from. There’s three different categories of heroes– tanks, damage, and support. It’s rated T for Teen, and has a 1.8/5 rating which is far too harsh in my opinion. It's also rated T for Teen, as it has violence, use of tobacco, and and blood.</p>

  <h3>Who is Moira?</h3>
  <p>On this site I’ll be focusing on one support character named Moira, who is a very beginner friendly character to learn. She’s a DPS support, which means she’s capable of doing a lot of damage along with healing. While she can be a very good support as well as a formidable opponent, the main learning curve with her occurs while trying to gauge when to heal or damage.</p>

<h3>Strategies</h3>
<p>Moira is a support who can reposition quickly and easily, allowing more movement flexibility for her teammates. As far as general strategy goes, I would recommend trying to stay near as many teammates as possible so that you can provide healing to any allies in immediate risk of dying. If a teammate is far away and on incredibly low health, sometimes it might be best to stay with the majority of the group instead of risking your own safety for the sake of one member; if you die, your teammates will soon follow after since they’ll be down at least one support member. I recommend only using the biotic orb for healing, since it can heal multiple teammates at a time– which is another reason why staying grouped up is a good strategy. When it comes to using your secondary fire, I would only really use it to target low health enemies, since it can drain the remaining health fairly quickly. Since targeting opponents directly will most likely make the other team try to go after you, using the fade ability to get away is the smartest way to ensure your safety. The fade ability is what makes Moira good enough to even be in diamond rankings, since it quite literally makes you invincible and in many cases allows you to escape tricky situations unharmed. Something I would almost never recommend is attacking opponent barriers. To put it simply, Moira is terrible at it and it’s also not your job– it won’t restore any of your biotic energy, heal you, or really do much damage to the barrier itself. If you have absolutely nothing else to do then go ahead, but your main objective is to make sure your teammates stay alive.</p>

<h3>Clips</h3>
<h4>Clip #1</h4>
<p>The first clip is going to be showcasing the fade ability- so damaging one of the opponents and then fading away quickly to avoid too much damage. In this clip, at the beginning of the game, I’ll also show how the fade can be used to move quickly, thus providing the team with more mobility.</p>
<h4>Clip #2</h4>
<p>In this one, I’ll use the primary fire to heal damaged enemies. I’ll probably do it towards the beginning of the game, since we’ll all be grouped up and I’ll be able to heal multiple of them more easily– I’ll also show what happens when I run out of biotic healing, and show how it recharges.</p>
<h4>Clip #3</h4>
<p>I’ll use the biotic orb to heal my teammates when my biotic energy runs out. While the orb is busy healing my teammates, I’ll go and use secondary fire to restore my biotic energy faster.</p>
<h4>Clip #4</h4>
<p>I’ll target one or more low health enemies and show how to use a mixture of fade, biotic orb, and secondary fire to kill members of the other team.</p>
<h4>Clip #5</h4>
<p>When I get my ultimate ability, I’ll attempt to use it in a more enclosed space so that I can both heal my allies and also damage the other team at the same time.</p>
