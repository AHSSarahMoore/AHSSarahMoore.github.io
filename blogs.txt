<h3>Article #1</h3>
<h4>What makes games entertaining?</h4>
<p>I think what makes video games so entertaining is the amount of variety. There truly is a game for everyone-- whether it be RPGs or gardening simulators. Even my grandparents enjoy some, although it's mostly Solitare. With a lot of games, the colorful graphics provide a lot of mental stimulation, which keeps most people engaged for hours on end. Not only that, but lots of games will keep updating with new content, so it's hard to become bored or content. The communication aspects that a lot of games have also help keep it entertaining-- it's possible to meet all types of people from around the world through them!</p>

<h3>Article #2</h3>
<h4>Why do people play video games?</h4>
<p>Although many think the only reason millions of people play games is due to them allowing the player to escape their reality for a bit, there’s a lot of other reasons too. A research company worked closely with game development studios for years and found that video games perfectly target three psychological needs– competency, autonomy, and relatedness.

People like to feel like they’re good at something and be recognized for it, and we enjoy accomplishing goals. That’s why games with level based reward systems and prizes are so popular.

People also enjoy being independent, which is why free-roam games are so popular. Being able to make choices without fear of facing real life consequences provides a type of freedom that they can’t experience otherwise.

Most everyone feels the need to to be important/ useful to other people– team games fill this need. Multiplayer games allow people to depend on each other, and it satisfies this need directly through praise.

<h4>My dream computer and why</h4>
<p><a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/b/ycbhP6">Dream Computer setup <a></p>
<p>Why this would be good for me- This setup would be good for me because I want a computer that can play games at least decently well, but I don’t need one that’s incredibly powerful. I mostly play games like Overwatch 2 and Minecraft, but being able to run those and similar games smoothly would be preferable. I also chose this because it’s super cute and I love Sanrio themed things.</p>

<h3>Article #4</h3>
<h4>What makes a game good?</h4>
<p>What makes a game “good” is highly subjective. For me personally, I’d say that how good a game is depends on both how fun a game is to play, and if said game is a decent quality in terms of graphics. The genre I was assigned is racing, which actually has some of my favorite games in it. I’d say some of the best games include Mario Kart and Forza Horizon games. They’re such good quality, and they’re able to be played over and over again without it becoming boring for most people. Some of the worst racing games would have to be Sonic Riders, Powerdrome, Need for Speed, and Asphalt due to either their lacking/ glitchy graphics, or because they becoming boring quite quickly.</p>
<h3>Article #5</h3>
<h4>Toxicity in gaming</h4>
<p>Toxicity is quite common in gaming; toxicity usually includes a gamer having a bad attitude and taking it out on others in the game via insults or other inappropriate comments. The reason it is so common in gaming is because of the anonymity that playing online provides. They’re able to dissociate their poor behavior online from their actual selves, so most of them don’t see their bad behavior as a big deal. The best way to combat this in most cases is to just mute whoever is being toxic. Most games also have a report feature, so reporting them for their bad behavior and forcing them to somewhat deal with the consequences of their actions is also a good idea. If someone is going to act poorly in game, there isn’t a whole lot you can do to actually change their behavior– I just recommend not giving in to their taunts, and remaining positive and nice whilst dealing with them. Sometimes someone could just be having a bad day, and responding in a much nicer way than them could help. If not, then just simply ignoring them is the best course of action.</p>
